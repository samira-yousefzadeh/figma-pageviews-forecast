# 📈 Time Series Forecasting: Wikipedia Pageviews for Figma (Software)

This project explores **time series forecasting** of daily Wikipedia pageviews for the article ["Figma (software)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma_(software)).

Developed as part of a **technical task for a Data Science Internship at SearchPilot**, the goal is to analyze trends and patterns in the pageviews and build a model to forecast future values.

## 📊 Features of the Project

### ✅ Data Collection
- Daily Wikipedia pageviews data for "Figma (software)" from January 2022 onward
- Source: [Pageviews Analysis Tool](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/)

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Line plots to visualize trends and anomalies
- Rolling averages and seasonal decomposition
- Weekday seasonality using boxplots
- Anomaly detection based on statistical thresholds

### 🔮 Time Series Forecasting
- Forecasting daily pageviews from **June 2025 to mid-2026**
- Model: [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)
- Evaluation of trend and seasonality components
- Interactive and static forecast visualizations
